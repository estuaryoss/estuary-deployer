## Estuary deployer
Estuary docker deployer service which will run your containers in docker or K8s with kubectl.   
Deployer service can run your commands using the [estuary-agent](https://github.com/estuaryoss/estuary-agent) service. Check-out the wiki !

## Use cases
-  Debug accelerator. No more logs attached to Jira. QAs can push the related bug-ish image to registry. Then in a docker compose QA can deploy "the bug" on a developer's machine or on dedicated debug machine (security reason due to docker sock mounting). The dev will have all he needs
-  Testing as a service. A complete enevironment SUT/BD/Automation Framework can be deployed and tested
-  Bring up Docker containers remotely through HTTP
-  Templating with Jinja2

## Service run

### Docker compose
    docker-compose up
    
### Docker run - simple
   
    docker network create estuarydeployer_default
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --net=estuarydeployer_default \
    estuaryoss/deployer:<tag>

### Docker run dind (docker in docker)
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --privileged --name some-docker -d docker:dind
    docker exec -i -t some-docker docker login
    docker exec -i -t some-docker docker run -p 8080:8080 -ti --net=deployer estuaryoss/deployer:latest
    docker exec -i -t some-docker docker run -p 8080:8080 -ti --net=deployer -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    estuaryoss/deployer:latest

### Eureka registration
To have all your deployer instances in a central location we use netflix eureka. This means your client will discover
all services used for your test and then spread the tests across all.  

Start Eureka server with docker:  
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 estuaryoss/netflix-eureka:1.9.25
```

Start your containers by specifying the full hostname or ip of the host machine on where your deployer service resides.  
    
    docker network create estuarydeployer_default
    docker run params:
    Optional:
            -e MAX_DEPLOYMENTS=3 ->  how many deployments to be done (docker only). Default is 10.
            -e EUREKA_SERVER="http://10.13.14.28:8080/eureka/v2" -> eureka server
            -e APP_IP_PORT="10.13.14.28:8081" -> the app hostname/ip:port. Mandatory if EUREKA_SERVER is used
            -e APP_APPEND_LABEL="lab" -> id will be appended to the default app name on service registration. Useful for user mappings service-resources on a VM
            -e FLUENTD_IP_PORT="10.13.14.28:24224" -> fluentd log collector agent target ip:port
            -e ENV_EXPIRE_IN=1440 -> [minutes] How long it will take before the env will be deleted. Default is 1440 minutes.
            -e SCHEDULER_POLL_INTERVAL=120 -> [seconds] The env expire scheduler polling interval. Default is 1200 seconds.
            -e DEPLOY_WITH=kubectl -> [docker/kubectl] The deployment environment. Default is docker.
    Mandatory:
        -p 8081:8080 -> port fwd from docker 8080 to host 8081
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -> docker sock mount
        --net=estuarydeployer_default -> bind to this net prior created

    estuaryoss/deployer:latest

### Fluentd
Please consult [Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd) for logging setup.
Estuary-deployer tags all logs in format ```estuary-deployer.**```

Matcher example:  

```xml
<match estuary*.**>
  @type stdout
</match>
```
Run example:  

    docker network create estuarydeployer_default
    docker run \
    -e FLUENTD_IP_PORT=10.10.10.1:24224 \
    -p 8080:8080
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --net=estuarydeployer_default \
    estuaryoss/deployer:<tag>

### Authentication
For auth set HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN env variable.  

Run example:

    docker run \
    -e HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN=mysecret
    -p 8080:8080
    estuaryoss/deployer:<tag>

Then, access the Http Api. Call example:
  
    curl -i -H 'Token:mysecret' http:localhost:8080/about

### Enable HTTPS
Set **HTTPS_ENABLE** env var option to *true* or *false*.    
Set the certificate and the private key path with **HTTPS_CERT** and **HTTPS_KEY** env variables. 
If you do not set cert and private key file env vars, it defaults to a folder in the same path called *https*, and the default files *https/cert.pem* and *https/key.pem*. 

## Environment variables injection
User defined environment variables will be stored in a 'virtual' environment. The extra env vars will be used by the process that executes system commands.  
There are two ways to inject user defined environment variables.    
-   call POST on **/env** endpoint. The body will contain the env vars in JSON format. E.g. {"FOO1":"BAR1"}  
-   create an **environment.properties** file with the extra env vars needed and place it in the same path as the JAR. Example in this repo.  

*! All environment variables described above can also be set using **environment.properties**.*

## Compilation - pyinstaller

```shell
pyinstaller --onefile --clean --add-data="rest/api/views/swaggerui/:rest/api/views/swaggerui/" main.py
```

## docker-compose deployment with metadata
The user can put any metadata under **x-metadata** section.   
The Deployer service does not enforce any metadata standardization.
However, it's a good practice to have:
-   the deployment name: **name**
-   the labels for the deployment: **labels**

The two fields are used by [seeder](https://github.com/estuaryoss/seeder) in order to organize and orchestrate the deployments.  
   
Obs: The x-metadata section is supported in compose version >= 3.3.
   
```yaml
    version: "3.3"
    x-metadata:
      name: alpine-test
      labels:
        k1: v1
        k2: v2
    services:
      alpine:
        restart: always
        image: alpine:3.9.4
        hostname: alpine
        entrypoint: tail -f /etc/hostname
```

## Output example
curl http://172.17.0.22:8083/docker/deployments
```json
{
   "code" : 1000,
   "description" : [
      {
         "containers" : [
            "346dd96ed55a        estuaryoss/discovery:4.0.8   \"/scripts/main_flaskâ€¦\"   16 seconds ago      Up 15 seconds       8080/tcp            6961ca05296ce48d_container_1"
         ],
         "id" : "6961ca05296ce48d"
      }
   ],
   "message" : "Success",
   "name" : "estuary-deployer",
   "timestamp" : "2020-08-15 20:32:25.971933",
   "path" : "/deployments?",
   "version" : "4.0.8"
}
```
